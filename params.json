Use the **Foundation** framework as the initial basis for your layout, and **Sass**, **gulp**, and **LiveReload** in your workflow.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Foundation**\r\n \t- Use **Foundation** as the client-side framework for this layout project. \r\n\t- Use the Foundation components that are necessary to complete the project. **Do not import all the components.**\r\n- **Sass**\r\n\t- Use **Sass** for your css preprocessor.\r\n\t- Practice using **inline media queries**\r\n\t- Practice using **nested styles**\r\n\t- Practice using **variables**\t\r\n\t- Practice using **mix-ins**\r\n\t- Because the project uses foundation, you do not need to include your own CSS Reset or Clearfix styles.\r\n- **Layout**\r\n\t- The mobile layout requires a **dropdown nav**.\r\n\t\t- **Easy Mode**: Use a custom nav for medium and large sizes and a foundation top-bar for small sizes. Hide the nav you don't need at the appropriate size.\r\n\t\t- **Hard Mode**: Use only the foundation top-bar for the nav. You will have to override the foundation styles with your own custom styles for both small large layouts.\r\n\t- **Media Query Ranges**: The layouts included show small, medium, and large sizes. Set the media ranges for the project **as you see fit**. Use Foundation's conventions for setting media query ranges.\r\n- **Server**\r\n\t- Use **LiveReload**.\r\n\t- Utilize **gulp** for your task runner (runs the server, gulp, gulp-sass, and livereload).\r\n\t- Instructions for **gulp+sass+livereload** setup are [here](https://gist.github.com/theRemix/b9f10de0bead6a7eaf5a)\r\n\t- Be sure that your bower components and node modules are listed in the **.gitignore** file.\r\n\r\n### File Structure \r\nAfter you finish setting up your environment, your file structure should look like this:\r\n\r\n``` \r\n.bowerrc\r\n.gitignore\r\nbower.json\r\ngulpfile.js\r\npackage.json\r\n/layouts\r\n\t/assets\r\n/node_modules\r\n/public\r\n\t/css\r\n\t\tstyles.css\r\n\t/bower_components\r\n\t/images\r\n\tindex.html\r\n/sass\r\n\tstyles.scss\r\n\t/partials\r\n\t\t_foundation.scss\r\n\t\t_settings.scss\r\n\t\t(more partials here if needed)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Process\r\n\r\n1. Whiteboard the layout at all sizes, from the most complex layout to the least complex layout and label the structure with appropriate **Foundation** classes, and add in your own classes and divs where appropriate.\r\n\t- mark divs with appropriate **.rows** and **.columns**\r\n\t- mark divs with **hide-for-** and **show-for-** classes\r\n\t- if there are any sibling **.row** items, it is a good idea to wrap them in a div with an your own identifying class.\r\n2. Write the HTML markup for the layout using the most complex layout as a reference.\r\n3. Ask an instructor to check your markup.\r\n4. Style the layout mobile-first, in this (suggested) order:\r\n\t- set base styles (base font size, general font, etc)\r\n\t- fine-tune your structural components/layout (widths, columns, padding, and margin)\r\n\t- typography\r\n\t- any other elements and details\r\n\t\r\n\r\n==========\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this exercise is to increase proficiency in web ui layout creation with focus on best practices*, cross-browser compatibility, accuracy, and speed (in this order).  \r\n\r\n*best practices in this exercise is defined as \"all common, current, and modern best practices in respect to semantic html5 markup[[1]](http://diveintohtml5.info/semantics.html)[[2]](http://html5doctor.com/lets-talk-about-semantics/)[[3]](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/11/18/html5-semantics/), [validated html](http://validator.w3.org/), [validated css](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), and clean javascript[[1]](http://www.thinkful.com/learn/javascript-best-practices-1/)[[2]](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/24-javascript-best-practices-for-beginners--net-5399)[[3]](http://www.thinkful.com/learn/javascript-best-practices-1/).\"\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
